# RAG_System_QA
# 
# # Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for AI Research Papers (Google Colab)
# 
# This notebook implements a RAG system to answer questions based on a collection of AI research papers, adapted to run in Google Colab.
# 
# ### Instructions for Colab:
# 1.  **Run the first two cells** to install the required libraries and enter your OpenAI API key securely.
# 2.  **Run the third cell** to upload your PDF research papers.
# 3.  **Run the remaining cells** to build and test the RAG system.
